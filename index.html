Twitter has long been (\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffortune.com\u002F2018\u002F04\u002F05\u002Ftwitter-terrorist-account-suspensions\u002F\"\u003Ebanning ISIS accounts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) from using their service, which has generally been praised. Right-wing provocateur and amateur herpetologist, Alex Jones was (\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vox.com\u002F2018\u002F8\u002F6\u002F17655658\u002Falex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories\"\u003Ebanned from multiple social media sites\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) more controversially in 2018. Anecdotally, the Jones ban has worked gangbusters. I have a general inkling that he’s out there doing his thing, which is his right, but he’s not being broadcast on the world’s most vastly impressive media platforms, and that’s good enough for me. Rumblings of cancel culture and little internet skirmishes looking to establish some kind of culturally-accepted ground rules, the infraction of which opens on up to public humiliation or worse, are commonplace. Of course, the big story now is that the President of the United States has gotten the Alex Jones treatment, and the social media refugee site “parler” has ben blacklisted by big tech as well. The usual suspects have been up in arms, claiming that their free speech is being infringed upon by the leftist big tech (sigh). The other usual suspects don’t seem to care, and rarely place much value on the right’s right to free speech anyways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s more and more clear that big tech has caused a tectonic shift in the way we view the world. What was once a novelty (I heard that Osama bin Laden had been killed on Facebook, before I heard it on the news - fascinating!) has become the norm. What is an “exclusive interview with the president” these days? What’s trending on twitter \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the news. Look no further than the replies on an image or video of an event that has gone viral to see proof of that. But if big tech creates the stories, does that mean they can smother them as well? Barack Obama is credited with being the first Presidential candidate to leverage his \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FBarack_Obama_on_social_media\"\u003Esuperior social media relevancy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E into winning the White House. Trump is nothing if not the second. Honorable mentions must be given to Sanders, Yang, AOC. Social media is now the foremost tool with which politicians ply voters, particularly on the national level.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes social media’s importance in the spheres of news and politics, not to mention generally, bring with it some kind of mandate to uphold free speech? Well technically no. And intuitively no. You can’t say “fuck” on the radio. You can’t show a penis on cable television. Why would you believe that any arbitrary piece of content would be allowed to be broadcast to billions on twitter? Why would you equate the right to stand on a street corner and scream “FRAUDULENT ELECTION!” with \u003Cem\u003Ebroadcasting\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the same message on twitter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founding fathers must have had some idea of the concept of broadcast media when they established the freedom of the press, articulated separately from the freedom of speech in the first amendment. But 1789 newspapers were not expected to publish the opinion of anyone who submitted an article. 2021 newspapers aren’t expected to do that. Twitter’s and other social media’s unique status as the “modern forum” as well as the “hands off” regulation provided by the following 26 words seem to lead people to the misguided conclusion that free speech should be enforced on their site: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider”. During the growth phase of social media, section 230 has been a godsend for big tech. When “technology companies” became “big tech”, a new complication came to light. Brands don’t want to be associated with \u003Cem\u003Emature content\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, and will go so far as to pull advertising dollars from your site if you can’t prevent their ad from being associated with such content. “Content hosts” (not publishers) employ teams of moderators and AI engineers to remove content that has violated “terms of service” (unrelated to editorial review) to ensure that content is “representative of the community” (not the company). With the banning of the President from Twitter, this much is clear to me: Social media companies are acting as content hosts when it suits them, and editors when it doesn’t. It’s time for government and society to think seriously about regulation of internet communication companies, lest our overton window be defined by literally a handful of people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen people talk about removing the “good samaritan” clause in section 230 (those who are against removal, i.e. most of the internet), they say that removing it will be the end of the internet as we know it. I struggle to see how that is a bad thing. I’m not referring to nonsense like the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FEARN_IT_Act_of_2020\"\u003EEARN IT Act\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. But can you not fathom a regulatory world where E2E encrypted messages exist, and Twitter is also held responsible for some or all of the content it hosts? Maybe I’m off the deep end, but can you not imagine a world where not every single person has multiple channels by which they can broadcast themselves to the world (children perhaps)? Dare I say it, a world in which that privilege is licensed? Maybe “big tech” is simply too big. What if the reach of an individual post could be limited? I am not ready to commit to a policy position here. Obviously I favor leaving section 230 untouched over crippling services that use encryption. However, the longer the freedom to broadcast goes on completely unregulated, the longer the freedom will be abused in bad faith.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n",slug:"freedom-to be broadcast"},{path:"\u002Fcontents\u002Ftechnology-and-freedom.md",frontmatter:{title:"Personal Freedom in the Digital Age",date:"2021-04-15",excerpt:"People are deleting their Facebooks, and that’s a euphemism for deleting accounts on many different websites and services. This is particularly noteworthy because it’s an example of people voluntarily giving up a convenient and even beloved technology to regain some freedom."},contentHtml:"\u003Cp\u003EI was reading the latest issue of Lapham’s Quarterly and came across an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.laphamsquarterly.org\u002Ftechnology\u002Ftechnical-error\"\u003Einteresting article\u003C\u002Fa\u003E written by none other than the Unabomber. He argues that freedom and technological advancement are in a constant battle that freedom is destined to lose.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the 1995 manifesto, I can’t say that freedom has sallied out successfully against its besieger, technology. Sparing only a mention for overt anti-freedom actions taken by internet-enabled governments, sparing only a mention for woke culture and the internet-enabled mob, what of the more mundane intrusions of technology into our lives? Read receipts on text messages, obligatory interaction with friends’ social media, work laptops, data leaks. These phenomena exist largely in a post-unabomber world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETake data breaches as an example. They fit perfectly into Kaczynski’s paradigm. When you signed up for Facebook, you were likely excited to connect with your friends and acquaintances. When you approved the terms and conditions for online banking with Capital One, you were probably excited to be able to check your balance online, or deposit checks from your phone. When you made an account with MyFitnessPal, you were probably trying to lose weight, or focus on eating better food, or drinking more water. I assume you never actually signed up for Equifax - fuck those guys, but it exposes an even darker side to our online lives: your data has likely been leaked by an organization to which \u003Cem\u003Eyou never actually gave your data\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. In any case, people don’t weigh the risks of data privacy when they use online products.; they just use them. In many cases they \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to use them. My employer requires that I use Slack, Google, Namely, Github, etc… during the course of my job. I can imagine other jobs requiring you use LinkedIn, Salesforce, Microsoft Office, Adobe, to register for webinars or conferences. Our freedom is being infringed upon by our employers because it’s simply impossible to do business otherwise. In the words of Ted Kaczynski: “Most of these educators, government officials, and law officers believe in freedom, privacy, and constitutional rights, but when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that their work is more important”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost people are happy to accept this. I don’t show up to work steaming mad because Github knows my name, email address, where I work, how productive I am at work. I don’t even think about it to be honest. Reading this article got me thinking, though. You know who does seem to care? 5g conspiracy theorists! I don’t think that the average (do the have a name?) 5g-er is as eloquent as Kaczynski, and hopefully none of them are as…. dedicated as he was. They do seem like they’re psychologically tormented by the fact they they live in a world in which they’re powerless to prevent multinational corporations to shoot waves of other people’s data through them onto the screen of the kid sitting next to them on the train watching TikTok. Frankly, I can sympathize with the fear. It’s psychologically traumatic to have no control in a decision that’s important to you. Us non-5g-ers can make fun and say “that’s a dumb thing to be important to those people”, and to some extent, maybe they’re faking it anyways and are just attention-seeking, or confrontational. In more socially-acceptable context, this same human emotion is understood to be the stuff of deepest nightmare. Buried alive, wrongfully convicted, drugged involuntarily; to be out of control, to not be free, is deeply disturbing to all of us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI share Kaczynski’s general pessimism about the future of freedom, but there are glimmers of hope that society at large has reached something of a consciousness about this issue. People are deleting their Facebooks, and that’s a euphemism for deleting accounts on many different websites and services. This is particularly noteworthy because it’s an example of people voluntarily giving up a convenient and even beloved technology to regain some freedom. Some governments are actively trying to design new paradigms around user data, user privacy, and how to treat those as legal entities. Apps like Signal are leaning into E2EE and a private-first product philosophy. Tech giant Apple is regularly rolling out new ways for users to manage how things like their location history, microphone and camera are used by apps. Technology isn’t canceled, but if people, governments, and businesses are each approaching this problem in some capacity, then there is serious traction toward a future in which what’s left of our freedom is truly cherished and protected.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n",slug:"personal-freedom in the digital age"}]}]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');(function(){try{eval("async function x(){}");var main="/client/client.343a40de.js"}catch(e){main="/client/legacy/client.f4ef0205.js"};var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src=main;s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main",main);}document.head.appendChild(s);}());</script>
