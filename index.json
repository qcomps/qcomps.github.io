Twitter has long been (<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/04/05/twitter-terrorist-account-suspensions/\">banning ISIS accounts</a>) from using their service, which has generally been praised. Right-wing provocateur and amateur herpetologist, Alex Jones was (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17655658/alex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories\">banned from multiple social media sites</a>) more controversially in 2018. Anecdotally, the Jones ban has worked gangbusters. I have a general inkling that he’s out there doing his thing, which is his right, but he’s not being broadcast on the world’s most vastly impressive media platforms, and that’s good enough for me. Rumblings of cancel culture and little internet skirmishes looking to establish some kind of culturally-accepted ground rules, the infraction of which opens on up to public humiliation or worse, are commonplace. Of course, the big story now is that the President of the United States has gotten the Alex Jones treatment, and the social media refugee site “parler” has ben blacklisted by big tech as well. The usual suspects have been up in arms, claiming that their free speech is being infringed upon by the leftist big tech (sigh). The other usual suspects don’t seem to care, and rarely place much value on the right’s right to free speech anyways.</p>\n<p>It’s more and more clear that big tech has caused a tectonic shift in the way we view the world. What was once a novelty (I heard that Osama bin Laden had been killed on Facebook, before I heard it on the news - fascinating!) has become the norm. What is an “exclusive interview with the president” these days? What’s trending on twitter <em>is</em> the news. Look no further than the replies on an image or video of an event that has gone viral to see proof of that. But if big tech creates the stories, does that mean they can smother them as well? Barack Obama is credited with being the first Presidential candidate to leverage his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_on_social_media\">superior social media relevancy</a> into winning the White House. Trump is nothing if not the second. Honorable mentions must be given to Sanders, Yang, AOC. Social media is now the foremost tool with which politicians ply voters, particularly on the national level.</p>\n<p>Does social media’s importance in the spheres of news and politics, not to mention generally, bring with it some kind of mandate to uphold free speech? Well technically no. And intuitively no. You can’t say “fuck” on the radio. You can’t show a penis on cable television. Why would you believe that any arbitrary piece of content would be allowed to be broadcast to billions on twitter? Why would you equate the right to stand on a street corner and scream “FRAUDULENT ELECTION!” with <em>broadcasting</em> the same message on twitter?</p>\n<p>The founding fathers must have had some idea of the concept of broadcast media when they established the freedom of the press, articulated separately from the freedom of speech in the first amendment. But 1789 newspapers were not expected to publish the opinion of anyone who submitted an article. 2021 newspapers aren’t expected to do that. Twitter’s and other social media’s unique status as the “modern forum” as well as the “hands off” regulation provided by the following 26 words seem to lead people to the misguided conclusion that free speech should be enforced on their site: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider”. During the growth phase of social media, section 230 has been a godsend for big tech. When “technology companies” became “big tech”, a new complication came to light. Brands don’t want to be associated with <em>mature content</em>, and will go so far as to pull advertising dollars from your site if you can’t prevent their ad from being associated with such content. “Content hosts” (not publishers) employ teams of moderators and AI engineers to remove content that has violated “terms of service” (unrelated to editorial review) to ensure that content is “representative of the community” (not the company). With the banning of the President from Twitter, this much is clear to me: Social media companies are acting as content hosts when it suits them, and editors when it doesn’t. It’s time for government and society to think seriously about regulation of internet communication companies, lest our overton window be defined by literally a handful of people.</p>\n<p>When people talk about removing the “good samaritan” clause in section 230 (those who are against removal, i.e. most of the internet), they say that removing it will be the end of the internet as we know it. I struggle to see how that is a bad thing. I’m not referring to nonsense like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EARN_IT_Act_of_2020\">EARN IT Act</a>. But can you not fathom a regulatory world where E2E encrypted messages exist, and Twitter is also held responsible for some or all of the content it hosts? Maybe I’m off the deep end, but can you not imagine a world where not every single person has multiple channels by which they can broadcast themselves to the world (children perhaps)? Dare I say it, a world in which that privilege is licensed? Maybe “big tech” is simply too big. What if the reach of an individual post could be limited? I am not ready to commit to a policy position here. Obviously I favor leaving section 230 untouched over crippling services that use encryption. However, the longer the freedom to broadcast goes on completely unregulated, the longer the freedom will be abused in bad faith.</p>\n","slug":"freedom-to be broadcast"},{"path":"/contents/2-technology-and-freedom.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Personal Freedom in the Digital Age","date":"2021-04-15","excerpt":"People are deleting their Facebooks, and that’s a euphemism for deleting accounts on many different websites and services. This is particularly noteworthy because it’s an example of people voluntarily giving up a convenient and even beloved technology to regain some freedom."},"contentHtml":"<p>I was reading the latest issue of Lapham’s Quarterly and came across an <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/technology/technical-error\">interesting article</a> written by none other than the Unabomber. He argues that freedom and technological advancement are in a constant battle that freedom is destined to lose.</p>\n<p>Since the 1995 manifesto, I can’t say that freedom has sallied out successfully against its besieger, technology. Sparing only a mention for overt anti-freedom actions taken by internet-enabled governments, sparing only a mention for woke culture and the internet-enabled mob, what of the more mundane intrusions of technology into our lives? Read receipts on text messages, obligatory interaction with friends’ social media, work laptops, data leaks. These phenomena exist largely in a post-unabomber world.</p>\n<p>Take data breaches as an example. They fit perfectly into Kaczynski’s paradigm. When you signed up for Facebook, you were likely excited to connect with your friends and acquaintances. When you approved the terms and conditions for online banking with Capital One, you were probably excited to be able to check your balance online, or deposit checks from your phone. When you made an account with MyFitnessPal, you were probably trying to lose weight, or focus on eating better food, or drinking more water. I assume you never actually signed up for Equifax - fuck those guys, but it exposes an even darker side to our online lives: your data has likely been leaked by an organization to which <em>you never actually gave your data</em>. In any case, people don’t weigh the risks of data privacy when they use online products.; they just use them. In many cases they <em>have</em> to use them. My employer requires that I use Slack, Google, Namely, Github, etc… during the course of my job. I can imagine other jobs requiring you use LinkedIn, Salesforce, Microsoft Office, Adobe, to register for webinars or conferences. Our freedom is being infringed upon by our employers because it’s simply impossible to do business otherwise. In the words of Ted Kaczynski: “Most of these educators, government officials, and law officers believe in freedom, privacy, and constitutional rights, but when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that their work is more important”.</p>\n<p>Most people are happy to accept this. I don’t show up to work steaming mad because Github knows my name, email address, where I work, how productive I am at work. I don’t even think about it to be honest. Reading this article got me thinking, though. You know who does seem to care? 5g conspiracy theorists! I don’t think that the average (do the have a name?) 5g-er is as eloquent as Kaczynski, and hopefully none of them are as…. dedicated as he was. They do seem like they’re psychologically tormented by the fact they they live in a world in which they’re powerless to prevent multinational corporations to shoot waves of other people’s data through them onto the screen of the kid sitting next to them on the train watching TikTok. Frankly, I can sympathize with the fear. It’s psychologically traumatic to have no control in a decision that’s important to you. Us non-5g-ers can make fun and say “that’s a dumb thing to be important to those people”, and to some extent, maybe they’re faking it anyways and are just attention-seeking, or confrontational. In more socially-acceptable context, this same human emotion is understood to be the stuff of deepest nightmare. Buried alive, wrongfully convicted, drugged involuntarily; to be out of control, to not be free, is deeply disturbing to all of us.</p>\n<p>I share Kaczynski’s general pessimism about the future of freedom, but there are glimmers of hope that society at large has reached something of a consciousness about this issue. People are deleting their Facebooks, and that’s a euphemism for deleting accounts on many different websites and services. This is particularly noteworthy because it’s an example of people voluntarily giving up a convenient and even beloved technology to regain some freedom. Some governments are actively trying to design new paradigms around user data, user privacy, and how to treat those as legal entities. Apps like Signal are leaning into E2EE and a private-first product philosophy. Tech giant Apple is regularly rolling out new ways for users to manage how things like their location history, microphone and camera are used by apps. Technology isn’t canceled, but if people, governments, and businesses are each approaching this problem in some capacity, then there is serious traction toward a future in which what’s left of our freedom is truly cherished and protected.</p>\n","slug":"personal-freedom in the digital age"},{"path":"/contents/3-cryptocurrency-regulation.md","frontmatter":{"title":"How Should the United States Approach Crypto Regulations","date":"2021-08-14","excerpt":"Last week was hectic for cryptocurrency communities.

What are we talking about here? A broker in traditional finance is a company that moves money and financial products around on behalf of accounts. Under U.S. law, these companies tend to be subject to very strict regulation. They handle peoples&#39; money, and the government views it as its mandate to nurture honest and trustworthy financial markets. This stance has been largely successful in developing a rich network of public and private investment opportunities that aare well-regulated and safe - not just for savvy and wealthy investors (overlooking the &quot;accredited investor&quot; paradigm for now), but for regular people too. ETFs, for example, are an innovative risk-management product that give working class Americans diverse exposure to equity that would be impossible to replicate at a small scale. The key long term benefit that regulation brings to this paradigm is trust. Without regulation, brokers could literally abscond with investors&#39; money, invest in different assets than advertised, or engage in any kind of shady activity. Instead, investors trust brokers. Wall Street and Silicon Valley are political entities in their own right and certainly try to influence regulations in their favor. Certainly there are examples of egregious wrongdoing over the decades as well. But fundamentally, people trust their 401k brokers. People trust that mutual funds are executing on their prospectuses. People trust that their checking account balance will be the same in the morning as it is today.</p>\n<p>Retrofitting these same regulations to cryptocurrencies does not serve the same purpose. P2P cryptocurrency networks are trustless.</p>\n<p>It is simply not possible for a network participant to steal funds in the way that it is with USD. If I give you my credit card details, or my bank account number, you can take my money. Every transaction I make in USD discloses one of those pieces of information to the receiver. Therefore, credit card readers are only issued to known merchants, and only known entities can join the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network. Privileged participants are held to a higher standard of reporting because they have elevated access and potential to do harm. On many p2p networks, there are no privileged participants of any kind. There are only equal participants. Each account has a public and private key, and transactions are generated with that pair in such a way that th private key is never exposed to the counterparty. Thus, a fundamental difference worth noting as a regulator: in USD, the only thing stopping a receiver of funds from lying, stealing, or mismanaging those funds is the law (or their concscience), whereas in cryptocurrency it is impossible to do those things outside of hacking a user&#39;s private key.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s dig back into some more specific language and detail.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I&#39;ve discussed about the key pairs, it is impossible to move money on behalf of anothr person without their absolute consent. Their consent is the only possible way for the money to move. With that said, this text could be referring to miners, stakers, decentralized finance (defi), or others. Let&#39;s look at miners and stakers, and more broadly refer to them as block producers (BPs). BPs collate <em>signed transations</em> into a block and add that block to the &quot;blockchain&quot;. A BP cannot arbitrarily move funds around between users (I cannot emphasize that enough). A BP is incentivized to include transactions by a fee, paid by the sender, in a block that it is producing. There is no barrier to entry to be a BP. Bitcoin is the most competitive blockchain to be a BP on, and to mine bitcoin effectively currently takes a lot of capital. Everyone is <em>allowed</em> to participate though. There is no requirement to meet face to face, there is no database that a BP needs to be granted access to before working. There is no way for a new BP to lie to the network, or alter the money supply, or any user&#39;s account balance. Thus, a second point for a regulator to consider: everyone can be a block producer, which means that the proposd reporting requirements apply to, on the upper bound, everyone.</p>\n<p>There is another interesting use case on the topic of a &quot;service effectuating transfers&quot; which is an automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX). AMM DEXs allow users to swap tokens from A to B or vice versa. The blue chip AMM is Uniswap, which recenlty surpassed $1b in fees generated. The way an AMM works at a high level is that many users pool their A and their B together, and then whoever wants to swap from A to B deposits A and withdraws B. Prices are set automatically based on the ratio of A to B in the pool. What&#39;s very attractive about this model to anyone interested in fairness and equality is that users at any deposit or swap size get the same economies of scale. Rather than going to a single large market maker (say Citadel Capital...) to privide liquidity for an asset trade, users can go to a pool of all of the market makers, and an average joe earns the same percentage returrn on their stake as a massive user. Thus, we have another noteworthy insight - increasingly complex instruments built on blockchains can be risky, certainly, but they can also deemocratize access to opportunities between investors of all wealth levels, whereas in traditional finance, there are many opportunuties that are just impossible to offer to investors below a minimum investment size.</p>\n<p>Reviewing, here&#39;s the quick rundown on why the bill text is misguided:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is impossible to move funds on behalf of another user on a &quot;cryptographically secured distributed ledger&quot;, making the revised broker definition nonsensical from the start</li>\n<li>Intentionally or otherwise, the scope of the increased reporting requirements that this bill seems to be proposing is everyone. Even individuals that don&#39;t own a single cent worth of crypto can produce blocks on a blockchain by running the software - it&#39;s free. These reporting requirements, traditionally, are reserved for institutions that are entrusted with the duty of holding, moving, and otherwise managing money on behalf of users, but actually have the capability to steal or mismanage that money without the threat of law enforcement.</li>\n<li>Applying these rules to decentralized finance applications will have the effect, intentionally or otherwise, of denying opportunies to non-ultra-high-net-worth individuals that this technology enables. High NW individuals can access whatever opportunuites they want traditionally, so access is only denied to &quot;regular people&quot;.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"alternative-proposals\"><strong>Alternative Proposals</strong></h3>\n<p>A regulator who has given me the benefit of the doubt thus far might now say &quot;well if this bill is not good, but I feel I must protect people from scams and ensure that taxes are being levied on the income and gains being made with this technology, what should I do?&quot;. Well, in my opinion, first and foremost is simply invest in enforcement.</p>\n<p>Scamming people and tax evasion are illegal. No change to the law is needed to enforce those laws. The SEC has certainly done their job in punishing companies and individuals that have broken the law. Sterling-reputation exchanges like coinbase and gemini continue to do business the right way in the US, while second-rate exchanges like bitmex, bitfinex, and poloniex have left the market. Some crypto enthusiasts will point to this as an example of entrepeneurs and talent leaving the US, but I disagree. If you can&#39;t operate above board, then you are not a visionary entrepeneur, you are sketchy, or at worst a true scammer. Exchange hacks in cryptocurrency&#39;s past are all the evidence needed that properly regulated exchanges that fit in the mold of traditional finance entities are a great boon to the average crypto user. I don&#39;t have any information on how well the IRS has done in extracting actual taxes owed from crypto users. My guess is not very well, so this is an area that Congress could look to for fundraising. US-compliant exchanges keep records of purchases and sales, and apps like koinly or debank make tabulating on-chain activity somewhat easy.</p>\n<p>In terms of actual new language in the legal code, I think Congress would do well to learn about the technologies and the entities at play in this space and craft legislation that fits the new model rather than expanding laws that don&#39;t make sense in the context. When it comes to losing innovators, that it actually happening, albeit not in the form of sketchy exchanges. Foundtions are being set up in Europe and Asia rather than the US because of regulatory ambiguity. If the US codified the proper, legal way to raise funds to develop a blockchain, we could be retaining innovation capital. Many projects have a non profit foundation that develops the sofware, and others have chosen to found companies to do the same. Some projects have raised funds with traditional venture capital, while others have made their fundraising available to all. The government could be paving the way toward public access to safe and complianct investments like &quot;ICOs&quot; that were popular in 2017 through clear guidlines for these teams doing fundraising.</p>\n<p>There are interesting questions to ask about the the intersection of crypto and the real world. Are funds stolen if someone tweets their private key? Is holding your signature in a multi-signature transation hostage illegal, or just bad system design? How many nodes make a blockchain &quot;decentralized&quot;? (e.g. is Libra decentralized?)</p>\n<p>In general, I believe this new legislative space should focus on paving the way for innovation here in the US, and empowering teams to build powerful democratic applications, not just in the realm of finance, but across all the digital industries. Where entities operate in the physical world, I think the government should swiftly intervene to stop criminal activity. However, where entities are acting as participants in decentralized protocols, I don&#39;t think the government has the ability to effectively accomplish its goals.</p>\n<p>A digital world where users are completely empowered to cut out all middlemen (brokers, lawyers, regulators, banks, etc...) is a revolutionary paradigm shift, one with which the government might not be comfortable. My final advice to the regulators is to come to terms with the fact that you can&#39;t control a decentralized ledger. You can&#39;t censor an uncensorbale record. Legislate the physical world, the on and off ramps, the human disputes, the exchanges and the corporations involved in crypto. Don&#39;t attempt to legislate the protocol level. It won&#39;t work, and in the process, you&#39;ll only lose the faith of your constituents to whom this is an important issue.</p>\n","slug":"how-should the united states approach crypto regulations"},{"path":"/contents/4-exclusion-on-the-left.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Exclusion and the left","date":"2022-01-27","excerpt":"On January 25th, 2022, Doreen Ford, a moderator on the subreddit r/antiwork went on Fox News to talk about the subreddit and the movement.  To put it mildly, it went poorly."},"contentHtml":"<p>On January 25th, 2022, Doreen Ford, a moderator on the subreddit r/antiwork went on Fox News to talk about the subreddit and the movement.  To put it mildly, it went poorly.  Her appearance was disheveled, she did not have a powerful presence, and she was easily railroaded by the host of the show in verbal jousting.  The fallout was fast and severe.  The subreddit went offline for a day, and she was ousted as a moderator, eight years after founding the subreddit.  The video and drama surrounding it went viral, as people tuned in to participate in the modern stockade.  While I’m sure the right got in some good pot shots, Doreen found no home on the left.  Members of the subreddit, and of new offshoot subreddits began armchair quarterbacking why she was a poor choice of representative for the movement because she’s a dog-walker and works only a few hours, rather than something like a nurse who would have more broad appeal.  People made comments along the lines of “couldn’t she have showered or picked up a little bit?”.  Many people felt that no one should have done any media at all, and apparently there had been a poll establishing that doctrine.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how well the interview went, the implosion of the subreddit is emblematic of the problems the left has unifying.  Politics today is simply a nasty business; there’s no way around that.  The right is hateful.  That seems self-evident.  But the left is not a friendly place either.  While white supremacists other alt-right coalitions hate groups of people, the left seems to focus on the individual.  This results in what you might call cancel culture - individuals being investigated and judged by the internet mob - rather than things like institutional exclusion of groups of people.  The right may like to ban books about “gender and/or race” from schools, but the left wants to prevent authors with whom they disagree from speaking at them.  Characters that embrace the right are immune from cancel culture.  Ben Shapiro, Kyle Rittenhouse, Joe Rogan, any prominent republican politician - these people are mobbed up.  They have protection.  They can’t be canceled.  The people whom this individual targeting strategy really ruins are the true leftists, and the left-curious who run afoul of the mob, e.g. Doreen.</p>\n<p>If you are in a position of distress and feel that radical action is needed to resolve this distress, but you just don’t know what, you will probably go solicit some opinions.  You might find that the government has been sold to corporations and the way to fix things it to take the capital back on behalf of the people, or you might find that things were actually great until we started tolerating welfare queens and SJWs dictating what acceptable behavior is and the way to fix things is to stop being offended and stop giving handouts.  Either way you look at it, there is something to hate, and something to admire.  The right has the game theoretical advantage of hating the poor, the weak, the huddled masses and loving the successful and powerful.  The right can build up an idol like Elon Musk, as an example, who has built multiple successful companies and regularly dunks on regulators.  Say what you will, but the man is unique.  He is a beacon around which to rally.  So what if his company got subsidized by government incentive programs - he’s just playing the game baby!  Sure he called that guy a pedophile but maybe he was having a bad day, who knows?  Keep an eye on Kyle Rittenhouse.  If he pursues a public life, the right will build a very nice narrative.  His successes are proof that boys will be boys and people deserve to defend themselves freely, or at least that leniency should be shown to good kids like him.  His failures will be chalked up to the media hit job on him.  It’s so sad how they ruined the life of this young man.  When you are in this group, you get love and support from the other members.  It’s a family of sorts.  Compare this to the left.  The left hates power, wealth and privilege.  They love the powerless, poor, and oppressed.  The paradox is once someone gets some renown, they are no longer powerless.  Thus the left distrusts its own members who succeed.  They are “sellouts”, “power hungry” or “not representatives of the movement (anymore)”.  As a PR principle, this is terrible.  Any leftist politician like Bernie or AOC who makes national headlines becomes easy pickings for opposition media to take down a peg.  Bernie has like 3 houses.  Elon may have more but it’s bad when Bernie does it because he could give 2 of those houses to the homeless; is he really walking the walk?  So when someone like Doreen who is so heartbreakingly committed to her ideals gets canceled by their own tribe, I really sympathize with that.  Perhaps mistakes were made - but the movement is about seeing humanity in the working class, understanding that even a dog walker needs to eat, and more than that, to live a fulfilling life.  The broader leftist movement has pillars related to protecting trans and autistic individuals.  This undecided radical sees the two paths, such as they are, and strictly from a recruiting perspective, it’s a lot easier for them to turn right.  </p>\n<p>At the end of the day, people want to be supported and celebrated and accepted by their communities.  It was a mistake to go on Fox News, but people make mistakes.  No Fox viewer was going to join r/antiwork, and no r/antiwork member cares what Fox says.  This is a no harm no foul situation, except for the harm that has since been internally inflicted.  For the crime of acting above her station, Doreen is the latest member of her tribe to be excommunicated.  I feel very badly for her and hope that she is able to make peace with this situation someday.</p>\n<p>Footnote: There are myriad possibilities for different parts of this from the interview itself to the rabid response, to the new clone subreddits popping up to be somehow funded or operated by groups acting in bad faith.  I have analyzed the situation at face value, but in the midst of something like a false flag operation, it is that much more important to keep peoples’ humanity in mind.  If Doreen’s appearance was sandbagged on purpose and she did sell out her community of eight years (with the effect that Fox viewers would get a bad impression of the anti work movement), then that’s once piece of the establishment down, and the left should be congratulating her for doing her part.</p>\n","slug":"exclusion-and the left"}]}
